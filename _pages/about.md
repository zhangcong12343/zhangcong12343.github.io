I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.ias.tsinghua.edu.cn), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, working under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaoyun Wang](https://www.ias.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1016/1217.htm). I earned my Ph.D. from the [Institute of Information Engineering](https://www.iie.ac.cn), Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2023, where I was advised by Prof. [Dongdai Lin](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~ddlin?language=en). Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in [Mathematics at Shandong University](https://www.math.sdu.edu.cn) in 2018.


My main research focus is on cryptographic protocols for secure computation. I am interested in both theoretical and practical aspects of secure computation techniques. More specifically:
- General Multi-Party Computation Protocols, especially Garbled Circuit (GC) and Secret Sharing based protocols.
- Specific Protocols, especially Private Set Operations (PSO), Private Information Retrival (PIR) etc.

You can find my CV here: [My CV](../files/EnglishCV.pdf). If you are interested in my research or would like to discuss any topics in cryptography, I would be delighted to connect. Please feel free to reach out to me via email zhangcong@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn.
