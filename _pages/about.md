I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.ias.tsinghua.edu.cn), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, working under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaoyun Wang](https://www.ias.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1016/1217.htm). I earned my Ph.D. from the [Institute of Information Engineering](https://www.iie.ac.cn), Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2023, where I was advised by Prof. [Dongdai Lin](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~ddlin?language=en). Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in [Mathematics at Shandong University](https://www.math.sdu.edu.cn) in 2018.


My main research focus is on cryptographic protocols for secure computation. I am interested in both theoretical and practical aspects of secure computation techniques. More specifically:
- General Multi-Party Computation Protocols, especially Garbled Circuit (GC) and Secret Sharing based protocols.
- Specific Protocols, especially Private Set Operations (PSO), Private Information Retrival (PIR) etc.

For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
