## Magic

Since Lu Chen appeared on the Spring Festival Gala in 2009, I have been obsessed with magic. I once served as the branch president of the Student Magic Association at Shandong University. The years I spent in the Magic Association were the most memorable for me during my undergraduate studies. Currently, I hardly perform magic anymore, but I still enjoy watching magic shows. Especially, I really enjoy visual magic, which looks like real magic. I have listed some magicians that I like.

- Lu Chen. Almost the enlightenment for all Chinese magic enthusiasts. [His bilibili homepage](https://space.bilibili.com/641975239?spm_id_from=333.1387.follow.user_card.click). [His Berglas Effect](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1c3XqY1E5K/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=2d454ee9022a6b2e70355b6c677a504f).
- Eric Chen. If you haven't seen it, I strongly recommend you to watch his [FISM ACT](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1tT421X7EQ/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=2d454ee9022a6b2e70355b6c677a504f).
- Patrick Kun. A magician from Thailand. [His visual magic show.](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1dr421F7n1/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=2d454ee9022a6b2e70355b6c677a504f)
- Shin Lim. My visual magic enlightenment, he showed me for the first time that magic can be so direct. I recommend his two representative shows: [52 shades of red](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV13x411n7M5/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=2d454ee9022a6b2e70355b6c677a504f) and [the dream act](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Xx411W7RK/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=2d454ee9022a6b2e70355b6c677a504f).
- Yif. Although Yif no longer appears in public, I still love his magic documentary [Yif Magic](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1d64y187cc/?p=2&share_source=copy_web&vd_source=2d454ee9022a6b2e70355b6c677a504f).
- Yu Ho Jin. I really like his [FISM ACT](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1DJbZejESD/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=2d454ee9022a6b2e70355b6c677a504f), which is very elegant. I also enjoy his [paper airplane act](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1AZ421p7DD/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=2d454ee9022a6b2e70355b6c677a504f).
